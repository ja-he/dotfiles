on my tp-t430 the hdd in the ultrabay adapter spins up on startup and spins loudly 
for a long time after, especially annoying in the uni library. 
the command to force it to enter the lowest power mode immediately is: 
    sudo hdparm -Y /dev/sdb 
where obviously sdb could be different at some point in the future.
