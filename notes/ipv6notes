To fix the problem I had with my connection I 
came to the conclusion that I had to disable ipv6, 
as per this post: 
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/905866/new-ubuntu-17-04-problem-your-connection-was-interrupted

To do it I followed this post's instructions: 
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/440649/how-to-disable-ipv6-in-ubuntu-14-04
which boils down to adding these lines to my /etc/sysctl.conf: 
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
checking whether it had the desired effect: 
    cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6
and if this doesn't return "1", activating sysctl.conf: 
    sudo sysctl -p
whereafter I checked again: 
    cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6
which should now return "1". 
Done.
