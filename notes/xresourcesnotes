The .Xresources file can be used to define settings, iE for URxvt. 

To actually apply these settings you'll have to use xrvd: 
    $ xrdb .Xresources 
or 
    $ xrdb -merge .Xresources 
which will apply the settings (merging them with existing ones, I believe). 

To get the current settings simply do 
    $ xrdb -query 
and to remove them 
    $ xrdb -remove
