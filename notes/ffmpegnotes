ADDING A COVER IMAGE TO ALL .mp3 SONGS IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY 
    I had to do this and it turned out to be a bit tricky, here's the command, firstly: 
        for song in *.mp3; do  
            ffmpeg -i "$song" -i cover.jpg -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -c copy -id3v2_version 3 -metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (front)" "$song.fixedcover"; 
        done
    So we loop trough all *.mp3-files in the current dir, and for each one we assign 
    the image called cover.jpg to be the new cover image for the song and output the 
    result as the original songname appended with ".fixedcover.mp3". 
    This is a bit hacky because when i tried to simply overwrite the songs the 
    song-durations turned into 2 seconds, which wasn't the case when i outputted 
    new files. 
    You could perhaps make this a little cleaner by autoremoving and -renaming the 
    files to clean up by adding this to the loop (but i havent tried this, so careful): 
        for ... 
            ...
            rm "$song"
            mv "$newsong" "$song"
        done
