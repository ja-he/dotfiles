ADDING A COVER IMAGE TO ALL .mp3 SONGS IN THE CURRENT DIRECTORY 
    I had to do this and it turned out to be a bit tricky, here's the command, firstly:ne
        for song in *.mp3; do  
            newsong="$song.fixedcover.mp3"
            ffmpeg -i "$song" -i cover.jpg -map 0:0 -map 1:0 -c copy -id3v2_version 3 -metadata:s:v title="Album cover" -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (front)" "$newsong"; 
        done
    So we loop trough all *.mp3-files in the current dir, and for each one we assign 
    the image called cover.jpg to be the new cover image for the song and output the 
    result as the original songname appended with ".fixedcover.mp3". 
    This is a bit hacky because when i tried to simply overwrite the songs the 
    song-durations turned into 2 seconds, which wasn't the case when i outputted 
    new files. 
    You could perhaps make this a little cleaner by autoremoving and -renaming the 
    files to clean up by adding this to the loop (but i havent tried this, so careful): 
        for ... 
            ...
            rm "$song"
            mv "$newsong" "$song"
        done 
    I've written this out as a functioning bash-script in .scripts under the name 
    albumcoveradder.sh so all you really have to do is run 
        ~/.scripts/albumcoveradder album_cover_file_name.jpg 
    in the directory where the songs in question are located. 

CONVERTING A VIDEO TO HEVC265 
    The basic flags are 
        -c:v libx265        (encode video to h265)
        -c:a copy           (copy audio codec)
        -x265-params crf=25 (constant rate factor,
                                0=lossless,51=worst,23=default,[18,28]=sane values)
    and an example usage would be 
        ffmpeg -i video.mp4 -a:v libx265 -x265-params crf=25 video_out.mp4
    However I am struggling with extreme durations of conversion, where it converts at 
    a rate of 10fps or about 20% the speed of the video, meaning a 1h video would take 
    5h to convert. I don't know if that's fixable yet, but it's not tolerable for 
    iE long NLSS VODs.  The conversion speed seems to go way down with crf=0 but the 
    improvements from crf=25 to crf=51 are rather small and likely not worth the quality 
    hit. 
    Additionally the conversion takes all cores to 100%, my temp to 80Â°C+ and 
    to have that keep up for 15 hours to convert a 3 hour VOD is obviously a no-go.
