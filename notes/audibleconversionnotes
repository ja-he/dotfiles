To convert the files downloaded from my audible library via a browser which 
are in .aa format, I use ffmpeg, as per this thread: 
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/16918/how-to-listen-to-audible-files

The relevant command is: 
    $ ffmpeg -i <inputfile.aa> [-codec copy] <outputfile.mp3>

In this command the "-codec copy" option makes it run a lot more quickly and 
apparently it also makes it scrollable in mpv for example, whereas without it 
it might cause trouble when scrolling / skipping through. 

On another note: 
    The files downloadable on audible are .aa or .aax depending on what quality 
    option is chosen from the dropdown on the website. The .aa can easily be 
    converted by what is described above, while the .aax apparenty require 
    you getting a decryption key from audible through some janky github-hosted 
    tool and then supply that key to ffmpeg...
