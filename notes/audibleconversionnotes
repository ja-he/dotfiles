To convert the files downloaded from my audible library via a browser which 
are in .aa format, I use ffmpeg, as per this thread: 
    https://askubuntu.com/questions/16918/how-to-listen-to-audible-files

The relevant command is: 
    $ ffmpeg -i <inputfile.aa> [-codec copy] <outputfile.mp3>

In this command the "-codec copy" option makes it run a lot more quickly and 
apparently it also makes it scrollable in mpv for example, whereas without it 
it might cause trouble when scrolling / skipping through.
