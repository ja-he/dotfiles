When PIA is stuck on connecting it could be due to an encrypted home directory. 
To fix it I followed the steps here: https://helpdesk.privateinternetaccess.com/hc/en-us/articles/227831828-Installing-the-PIA-app-on-Linux-with-encrypted-home-directories

sudo mkdir /opt/
sudo rm -rf /opt/pia_manager
sudo mv ~/.pia_manager /opt/pia_manager
ln -s /opt/pia_manager ~/.pia_manager
sudo rm /tmp/pia*

worked!
