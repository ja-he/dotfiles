Creating a Windows ISO with dd does not work, the drive wont be bootable. 
Instead the best options are: 
    1. WoeUSB
    2. Rufus in a VM 
Now setting up a VM is no problem but the installation process there is still tedious 
and you also have to deal with adding the usb to the VM which in my limited 
experience sucks.
To user WoeUSB simply 
    $ sudo apt-get install woeusb
(maybe after an apt-get update) and then run 
    $ sudo woeusbgui 
I had some issue with it nagging me about ibus somehow not having root permissions, so 
i just sudo-forced it, not clue if that's necessary for it to work in general but 
I'd assume so, since it's basically doing what dd does as well. 
The UI is so basic I dont really need to explain it, but at the top you choose the ISO 
and at the bottom you choose the drive (maybe LSBLK to make sure you dont fuck up...?)
