so for notifications you need a deamon running, like dunst. 
dunst can be configured through dunstrc (in ~/.config/dunst/). 

When dunst says "Cannot acquire 'org.freedesktop.Notifications'" then another
daemon is already running. In my case (curiously only on the t430 not the e31
install of xubuntu19.04) this was caused by xfce4-notifyd.

So for i3-looking basic notifications use dunst, 
for the nice xfce looking ones maybe try xfce4-notifyd...
