NO PERMISSIONS ISSUE: 
    I had a problem with permissions, it said I couldn't write a PDF, even sudo 
    wouldn't let me. 
    To solve this I edited the file 
      /etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml 
    such that the Line that said 
      <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PDF" />
    now said 
      <policy domain="coder" rights="read|write" pattern="PDF" />
    and this solved my issue. 

CONVERT PNG TO PDF: 
    It's as easy as 
      convert imagefile.png outputfile.pdf
