did lots of things, got mostly where i wanted using the material theme off 
    settings > plugins > search 
and then tweaked it to the moon. 

in terms of theme, tried lots, they mostly suck because intellij just 
highlights so goddamn many things. 
best just to tweak that shit in 
    settings > editor > colos scheme > general
already found out: 
    annoying click on text highlight = "identifier under caret"
