Initially my desire was to bind my Bluetoot-headset-button to 
skip to the next song in MPV and i tried to do it via the mpv 
config file, but it neither recognized the keycode, nor the 
name "X86AudioNext" that xev gave me, so I decided to remap it 
to "greater", the default binding in MPV for that purpose. 

To do this: 
    $ xev 
    // find out which keycode you want to replace and the name of the key
    // you wish to target instead
    $ xmodmap -e "keycode 171 = greater"

That's it.
