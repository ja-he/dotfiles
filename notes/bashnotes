REMOVING A SUFFIX FROM A STRING 
    I had a set of filenames of songs that ended up having ".fixedcover.mp3" as a 
    suffix (so that they weren't the overwriting the original files but ffmpeg still 
    would identify them as mp3s) and to remove that suffix i did the following: 
        for song in *.mp3; do 
            newsong="${song%.fixedcover.mp3}"
            mv "$song" "$newsong"
        done 
    The crucial part here is of course the 
        ${song%.fixedcover.mp3} 
    where anything after the "%" is a regex so i could write "${y%.*}" to remove anything 
    after and including the first period in the variable y.
